                insurance plans, your employees get coverage of treatment costs
                for Coronavirus. This includes hospitalization bills, pre, and

                <strong>Pre-Existing Disease Coverage</strong>
                <br />
                Most insurance providers keep a window of 2-4 years for
                Pre-Existing Diseases(PED) like Diabetes, Cataract, Epilepsy,
                Cancer, Sleep Apnea, etc. With Plum, your employees get PED
                coverage from Day 1.

                <br />
                Younger members of your workforce are often worried about the
                financial strain that comes with the birth of a child. We take
                this away by covering all maternity and newborn care costs from
                the day the policy is issued.

                of your employees depending on your budget. Every member of the
                family added to the cover enjoys the same benefits as the
                employee.
