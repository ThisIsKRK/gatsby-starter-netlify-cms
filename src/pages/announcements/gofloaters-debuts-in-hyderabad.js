                Commenting on the launch Shyam Sundar Nagarajan says, &ldquo;We
                are very excited to launch our operation in Hyderabad. The city
                has witnessed one of the highest co-working transactions in the
                recent past. On-demand shared workspaces have gained tremendous
                acceptance by corporates and independent workforce. At
                Hyderabad, we have on-demand spaces spread across Jubilee Hills,
                Banjara Hills, Gachibowli. We are closing on some more new
                partners and further expand in farther location to ease
                stressful work life&rdquo;.{" "}

                GoFloaters&rsquo; philosophy is to create sustainable on-demand
                workspace eco-system for the consumer (workforce), occupier and
                asset owner. This is possible by addressing the effective
                utilization of existing real estate spaces for co-working
                leading to 100% occupancy instead of lean period loss, leading
                to increase in the regular income and collaborative yields of
                all the stakeholders.{" "}

                &ldquo;One needs to pay just INR 25 for an hour and with no
                obligation of ordering food at any of our listed locations.

                solopreneur, freelancer, independent workers or remote employee
                who want to able to run bootstrapped business. We see this as a
                significant disruptor in the market for on-demand, flexible,
                affordable, hassle-free work and meeting spaces which seems to
                be the future of work.&rdquo; adds Srivatsan Padmanabhan.{" "}
