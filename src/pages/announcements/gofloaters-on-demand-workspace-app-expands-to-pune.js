                &ldquo;What the new normal is going to be is anyone&rsquo;s
                guess. But one thing is for sure that we are going to see

                employees more flexibility. A recent GoFloaters survey of
                entrepreneurs and business professionals revealed nearly 75% of
                the respondents wanted to work outside the office at least twice
                a week. Many leaders we spoke to all echoed that they saw a 20%
                increase in employee productivity during the lockdown.&rdquo;
