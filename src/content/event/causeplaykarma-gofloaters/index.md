Quick wins are the shortest distance between possibilities and reality. Through CausePlayKarma, community bets on a quick win – through the engine of learning – and brings a dream to reality.

**Here’s how this would work :**

Let’s say 30 diverse people of Chennai come together for a one day beginner’s calligraphy workshop. The event will be facilitated by Niranjan, a renowned designer & artist. And here’s how this brings possibilities to reality – the proceeds will be used for the operations of an NGO called Prajnya. At the end of the session, the collected funds will be given to the representative of Prajnya.

**About Prajnya:**

A nonprofit center for research, public education and network building on issues relating to peace, justice, and security.
Prajnya presently works in two areas, represented by the thematic rubrics “Politics, Security and Women” and “Education for Peace.”
