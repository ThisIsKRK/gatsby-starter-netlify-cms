<h4>With remote work as the new normal here are some suggestions for workation choices in India</h4>

Every day is becoming a monotonous routine where we as working professionals are stuck in the rut of work-eat-sleep-repeat pattern. Besides, remote working is just burdening with more workload for an average employee who is used to the office culture because let’s be honest working side-by-side with our colleagues is a different experience.

At this stage what could one do to break this monotony but at the same time balance business and pleasure? One word, Workation. Business combined with leisure is a solution to break the cycle. But you might say,’ hey we are amid a pandemic, are you crazy?’. It is hard to beat that logic, but with necessary precautions a workation might just be possible.

-	**Plan ahead** – Inform your team, do not vanish

-	**Budget your trip** – It can be tempting to make unnecessary expenses, but book a trip that’s worth every penny

-	**Get best ROI** – not just for start-ups, best ROI applies to any workation place you are looking to rent for the next 15-20 days. Make sure you do not run around for everything, you are well-serviced with the right of amenities are available.

-	**Give yourself** (and your family) time to settle and enjoy

-	**Schedule a routine** – From waking to sleeping, it is best to schedule if you are on workation. Setting expectations for self (and you family) is a great idea for fab time.
 
Okay so half the hurdle is won in preparation but where should I head. What are the safe options for myself and the family where I can work in peace and have a safe good time?

<br><br>

*Important! Hey there!*

*All resorts are perfect with a calming and peaceful work atmosphere. 
Each of the resorts and locations come with different amenities and vibe.   
Due to the scenic and remote locations of the resorts, the complimentary Wi-Fi access might be limited. We advise you to individually check with your choice’s basis your requirements for a workation. Portable internet devices are advised.
