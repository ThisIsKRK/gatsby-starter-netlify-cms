As I said in my previous post, there’s a coworking space for every need. And if you take a look at our list of spaces, you’ll find plenty of different types of coworking spots—everything from coworking cafés and restaurants to shared offices, private cabins, and meeting spaces. With so many choices I’d totally understand if you had a hard time zeroing in on the perfect spot. So, I’ve decided to help by breaking it down for you.

**What kind of coworking space do you need?**

1. Are you a soloprenuer or part of a team? Do you own a startup or small business? The answers to these questions will help you figure out how much space you need and for how many people. If it’s only you, a coworking café or private cabin should do. But if you work in a team, a shared office space will be better suited.
2. Do you see your team having brainstorming sessions often? Are client meetings and interviews on the agenda? If you answer yes to those two questions then you’ll definitely need a coworking space where there’s access to a conference room or a training hall.
3. The field you’re working in can also influence the kind of space you want to work out of. As a writer or an artist, you might want a fun, creative space to fuel your imagination. However, as a consultant you may prefer a private cabin for quiet and peace.
4. Remember to always keep your budget in mind. Whether you’re working solo or have a startup, come up with an amount you’re willing to spend on a coworking space and look for spots that fit the bill.
5. Shortlist a few locations you (and your team) will find convenient. This is very important, as you don’t want to spend more time on the road than at the office. Pick a couple of neighbourhoods that are easily accessible for your team and you, and look for coworking spaces there.
6. All coworking spaces come with comfortable seating, plug points and Wi-Fi. But if you need to make a presentation or hold a training session, you’ll need access to a whiteboard or projector. Some of you may need printers and scanners on hand, depending on your work. In which case it makes sense to pick a coworking space that provides all the equipment and amenities you need.

What are your work timings like? Maybe you have a deadline to meet and need to work late, or you’re the type of person who gets your best work done in the mornings. Some of you might even have clients in other countries and will have to work nights. So, check the timings of the coworking space you choose, to make sure it’s open and available for when you need it.

Now that you’ve reached the end of this piece, I hope you have more clarity when it comes to picking the right coworking space for _you_! What are you waiting for? Go forth to our list of coworking spaces and make your choice.
