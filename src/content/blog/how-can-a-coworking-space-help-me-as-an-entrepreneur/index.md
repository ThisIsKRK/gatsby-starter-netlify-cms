Being an entrepreneur is great! You’re your own boss. You call the shots. You can make your own hours. Which probably accounts for the rise in people seeking self-employment and becoming entrepreneurs over the last few years. According to a GEM survey, there was an increase to 14.9% in entrepreneurial intention when compared to 9% the previous year ([source: Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/perception-about-entrepreneurship-on-rise-in-india-gem-report/articleshow/63380950.cms)). Even the fear of failure rate has gone down.

As more people seek to be entrepreneurs, they need a space to ideate and create and get the ball rolling. This is where coworking spaces come in.

### Why choose a coworking space?

You might be dreaming about the perfect office at a prime location. But real estate is expensive! And when you’re starting out you really don’t have the big bucks to spend on a fancy office. Also, maintaining an office and being responsible for the space can take a lot of your time, energy and resources. But, at the same time, you do require a spot where you’re inspired to work and create. With a coworking space, you get a functional and dedicated space to work out of, at a location of your choice and most importantly at a price that suits your budget.

### Flexibility and freedom

As an entrepreneur, your work hours are not fixed. You might be meeting clients the whole morning and will only spend time at your desk after lunch. On another day you might need a desk only for a couple of hours in the morning to prepare for a meeting, as you’ll be out the rest of the day. So, taking an office on lease for a year makes absolutely no sense. Instead, you could drop into a coworking space be it a café or a hotdesk as needed and get your work done. You’re guaranteed a seat and Wi-Fi. The best part is that you only pay for the hours you use the space, at least with GoFloaters!

### A space for every need

When you’re running your own business, there’ll be a lot of meetings with clients, investors, and even vendors. It helps to have an appropriate space to take these meetings. Thanks to coworking spaces, you can pick a spot at a location that is convenient for you and the person you’re meeting with. For a casual meeting with a client, you could pop into a coworking café and make a deal over a pot of tea. If you need to make a presentation to your investors, rent out a professional meeting or conference room at a great location for a couple of hours and wow them. Many of these spaces come equipped with projector and whiteboard—so you don’t have to worry about investing in or lugging around your own equipment.
