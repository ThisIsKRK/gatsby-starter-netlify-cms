There’s a buzz around the word coworking and not without reason. Take a look at the many new coworking spaces popping up and the people heading to work out of them. But, just in case you’re one of the few wondering what all the fuss is about and what makes coworking spaces so special–we’ve got you covered!

**So, what _IS_ a coworking space?**

1. A coworking space is essentially a workspace where freelancers, startups, entrepreneurs, sales teams, and remote workers can drop in and get their work done.
2. This workspace could be a café, a shared office space, a hotdesk, a private cabin or even a conference room—it all depends on your needs.
3. Most coworking spaces come with basic amenities: think fast Wi-Fi, comfortable seating, plus all that you’d require to get some work done. \*
4. Many shared offices, and meeting and event spaces come fully loaded with amenities such as projectors, whiteboards, printers, scanners… I could go on!
5. You can rent a coworking space by the hour (only at GoFloaters!), by the day, or per month. So, you don’t have to worry about spending big bucks to secure a work spot at a convenient and well-known part of town.

\*I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that many coworking spaces have food and drink on hand to help fuel your brain while you work on your masterpiece.

So, if I had to describe what a coworking space offers using three words, they would be **Freedom**, **Flexibility**, and **Fosters Creativity**. Okay, okay that’s more than three words. But you get my drift.

**The coworking culture**

When compared to conventional offices, coworking spaces inspire and nurture creativity. There’s a particular energy when you walk into a coworking café or a shared office space. You’ll find some folks deeply involved in their creation, others brainstorming and having animated discussions.

Coworking spaces come with a culture of its own. Even researchers have noted that people thrive more in coworking spaces when compared to regular offices. Take a look at this piece [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2015/05/why-people-thrive-in-coworking-spaces) did on the subject.

**Work-Life balance**

Another important aspect of coworking spaces is the work-life balance it offers. Remember, how I mentioned **Freedom** and **Flexibility** earlier in this post? We’re part of a generation where many of us work on the go or remotely. You could be a work-from-home parent or a consultant who is always on the go or even part of a startup–there are numerous reasons.

A coworking space offers you the option of working in an environment that encourages productivity without having to head to a regular office or a 9-5 job. You can choose a spot that is conveniently located, for a time when you need to get your work done, pop in, and get on with the job. In this way, a coworking office or café is a space that promotes work-life balance–something that we as millennials are always trying to find.

**Get (co)working!**

Now that you know what a coworking space is and what makes it so unique, do you see yourself working out of one? A space that is located close to you. A workspace that helps you be productive and won’t cost you the earth! Take a look at the coworking spaces we have on offer and find one that’s the perfect fit for you.
