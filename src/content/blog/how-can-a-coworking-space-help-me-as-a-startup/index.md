India is home to more than 20,000 startups. You read right! Check out this piece in [The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/firm-footing-bengaluru-is-still-indias-technology-startup-capital/articleshow/71089577.cms), which breaks down the number of startups city wise. We are a country with a growing number of millennials, a lot of homegrown talent, and folks just bursting with ideas and innovations. As people come together to create and build, they need a place to work out of.

I’m sure you’ve heard the stories of the early startups that made it big, which were founded out of a cramped garage or tiny spare room. But thanks to coworking spaces, your startup can do one better and work out of a spot that inspires creativity and productivity.

### So, how does a coworking space help your startup?

**It’s cost-effective**

Your startup isn’t going to take off overnight and start earning the big bucks immediately. Initially, there will be a lot of spending—on talent, materials, employees, etc. depending on the kind of business. And while you might want a nice office space at a great location, that definitely will eat into your funds. But with a coworking space, you get access to a place to work from at a convenient location that won’t break the bank.

Not only will you have access to comfortable seating and Wi-Fi, but coworking spaces like shared offices also come with amenities such as scanners and printers among others. This means your startup saves on investing in office equipment as well.

**It’s flexible**

There are so many types of coworking spaces that you can choose one that suits your business, yours and your coworker’s needs. With a coworking café or restaurant, you pay only for the hours you use. So, this will work for your startup if your coworkers and you are scattered all over India (or the world!) and don’t need access to a desk on a regular basis.

If there’s a chance your startup won’t permanently be based in a particular city then a shared office makes sense. You pay by the month and don’t have to worry about a long-term lease. This means your startup can pick up and move whenever needed to another location.

Whether you need to make a presentation or have a meeting with your team or even a private interview with someone, there are options in the form of meeting and event spaces as well as private cabins—all of which can be booked by the hour. You can’t get this sort of flexibility with a regular office.

**It’s convenient**

Having an office of your own comes with a lot of maintenance and responsibilities. Taking care of the building, buying chairs and desks, getting the internet installed, getting a cleaning staff organized among others. Not only is all this expensive it also takes up your valuable time. And when you have a startup you already have a hundred things going on. So, choose the convenient option and go with a coworking space and just plug and play.

A coworking space is built for a startup. It’s conducive to growing a business and offers you freedom and flexibility. Check out our [complete list](https://gofloaters.com/office-spaces/) of coworking spaces and find one to put your startup in.
