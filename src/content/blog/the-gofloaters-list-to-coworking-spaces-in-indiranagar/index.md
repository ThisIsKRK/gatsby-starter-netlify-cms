Who would have thought this sleepy neighbourhood filled with families and retirees would, in just a decade, become the place to be in Bangalore (Bengaluru). Restaurants and pubs line the streets, the vibe of the area is fun and free, and you’ll find people walking everywhere. On the flip side, the popularity of the area has made property prices skyrocket and the narrow streets aren’t able to contain the traffic. Nevertheless, everyone wants to live here and party here and even work here!

### Coworking cafés
