GoFloaters has been experimenting with different kinds of spaces and opening up for the go-getters on-the-move. Most importantly, we differ from the typical coworking space provider in 4 fundamental ways. We are :

1. Distributed as distributed can get with over 400 spaces to choose from across 4 cities (as of 30th Nov 2019)
2. As Flexible as flexible can get with hourly, daily, weekly and monthly passes. We don’t do any contracts or agreements that bog you down.
3. Affordable as affordable can get with spaces that can be booked at Rs 25 / hr / person
4. Plug and play. Just get yourself and your devices and get cracking.

In the pursuit of offering more on-the-go choices for our members, we have partnered with Shell’s Deli2Go outlets and bring them to you. We have enlisted 4 Shell Deli2Go outlets in Chennai on the [GoFloaters app](https://www.gofloaters.com/).

1. [Shell Deli2Go Korattur](https://app.gofloaters.com/#/home/explore/spacedetail/-LsLL4jV_b8nINapvDud)
2. [Shell Deli2Go Pallikaranai](https://app.gofloaters.com/#/home/explore/spacedetail/-LrnNkn0-af9ksCZhFr2)
3. [Shell Deli2Go Kazhipattur](https://app.gofloaters.com/#/home/explore/spacedetail/-LrhLXm2qmF0Eo77-UWz)
4. [Shell Deli2Go Kelambakkam](https://app.gofloaters.com/#/home/explore/spacedetail/-LriFmW884C76_CabkNi)

This pilot will run for a period of 3 months and during this pilot period the space is available to at zero Cost. Here are the 4 spaces that we have for you. If this pilot is successful, which is very likely to happen based on the response that we are already getting, Shell will open up additional outlets for go-getters like you.

Pro Tip : While you are at Shell Deli2Go, don’t forget to enjoy the “Podi Idli” range they have introduced!
