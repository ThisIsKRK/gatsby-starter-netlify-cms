Koramangala with its wide roads (when compared to other parts of the city), tree-lined streets, beautiful homes and aesthetic apartment buildings has always been a much sought after neighbourhood to live in.

When the tech boom happened, this area that is in between Electronic city and bengaluru proper, took off. Young professionals flocked to live here. Which meant tons of offices, restaurants, pubs and commercial buildings came up.

The other side of the coin is that tons of development work are constantly happening like construction projects, the building of the Ejipura- Kendriya Sadan flyover, and new sewage pipes being put in among others. Roads are constantly being dug up and structures being demolished. Which means residents have to face traffic woes along with noise and air pollution. So, if you live in this area you definitely want a space close by to work from.
