To start with, coworking spaces are awesome because there’s literally a space to meet every person’s requirements. Are you a writer working on the next great Indian novel or a graphic artist designing a masterpiece? Check into a coworking café or restaurant that is casual and cosy, with plenty of coffee available to fuel your creativity.

Do you own a startup and require an office in a suitable area that won’t break the bank? Why not rent a shared office that comes jam-packed with amenities? If you’re a consultant or salesperson, who spends more time working out of hotel lobbies and parking lots than in an office, drop in at a conveniently located private cabin or a hotdesk.

Whether you need to make a presentation to investors or hold a workshop for new employees or even host a party to celebrate closing a deal, there are conference rooms, training halls and event spaces available, all of which come under the umbrella of coworking spaces.

See, I wasn’t exaggerating when I said there’s a coworking space for every person. And while the various spaces serve diverse purposes there are three common factors that tie them all together—**comfortable seating, plug points,** and **Wi-Fi**.

**TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL!**

Then you have the coworking spaces that come loaded with frills and amenities that elevate it from being just functional to being great!

**Amazing design**

Optimal layout and lighting and the best utilization of space can set a coworking space above the competition. A well-designed space with dedicated workspaces, greenery, and decorative touches can inspire you to work.

**Ergonomic furniture**

Yup, all coworking spaces offer seating. But there are coworking spaces with furniture that’s not just easy on the eye but is also ergonomic and functional. And if you sit behind a table for hours, you know how important that is. A chair with lumbar support and comfortable cushioning allows you to work without feeling the hours go by.

**Fully equipped**

The availability of amenities such as a projector, a scanner, a whiteboard and a printer, etc. at a coworking space is always a plus, especially, if you need to make a presentation or hold a workshop. This way you don’t have to invest in equipment and can use that money in more useful pursuits instead.

**Prime location**

Real estate is expensive and renting an office in a popular locale will probably be way beyond one’s budget. Thankfully, there are coworking cafés and shared offices situated in coveted locations. So, you can work out of a good address without spending a bomb.

**Extra Facilities**

Parking onsite, different types of workspaces (such as private cabin, shared offices) within the same building, membership passes, and tie-ups and discounts with partnered companies are all additional perks, offered by some coworking spaces. This certainly adds to the appeal of working out of them.

**Good food and drink**

There are coworking spaces that are known for their delicious food, artisanal coffee, and cold beers among others. You never know when you’ll need some sustenance to fuel your creativity. So, it’s always nice to have the option available.

**Great community**

In a coworking space you have people from different professional backgrounds working together. A good coworking space has a certain vibe and culture to it. A space that promotes networking and is conducive to collaborating and being productive will always be sought after.
