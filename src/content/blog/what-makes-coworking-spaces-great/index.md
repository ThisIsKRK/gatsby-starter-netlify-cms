**Its time to step out and explore the** [Hybrid Choices](https://gofloaters.com/blog/top-5-coworking-trends-in-2021-as-per-experts/) **.**

To start with, coworking spaces are awesome because there&#39;s literally a space to meet every person&#39;s requirements outside of home, around you neighbhourhood. [Are you a someone who WFH](https://gofloaters.com/blog/founders-unbound-wfh-jobs-go-beyond-programming/) or writer working on the next great Indian novel or a graphic artist designing a masterpiece? Check into a coworking café or restaurant that is casual and cosy, with plenty of great vibes to fuel your creativity.

Do you own a start-up and require an on-demand office in a suitable area that won&#39;t break the bank? Instead of investing on long-term office real estate, credits to the global acceptance of Remote Work, it might be the best time to rent a office or meeting space that comes jam-packed with amenities. If you&#39;re a consultant or salesperson, who ought to spend time on outdoor meetings its time to think beyond parking lots and hotel lobbies, drop in at a conveniently located private cabin or a hotdesk.

While we are [flourishing with remote work](https://gofloaters.com/blog/10-powerful-quotes-on-remote-working/), people are yearning for in-person meeting and the collaboration opportunities that made work even more exciting. Maybe it is time to rethink and realise the new concept of on-demand office &amp; meeting spaces whether you need to make a presentation to investors or hold a workshop for the employees or even host a party to celebrate closing a deal, there are conference rooms, training halls and event spaces available, all of which come under the umbrella of coworking spaces.

See, I wasn&#39;t exaggerating when I said there&#39;s a coworking space for every person, every team. And while the various [spaces](https://gofloaters.com/office-spaces-for-rent-in-new-delhi/) serve diverse purposes there are three common factors that tie them all together— **comfortable seating, plug points,**  and  **Wi-Fi**.

**YOUR MODERN OFFICE: TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL!**

Then you have the coworking spaces that come loaded with frills and amenities that elevate it from being just functional to being great!

1. **Amazing design**

    Optimal layout and lighting and the best utilization of space can set a coworking space above the competition. A well-designed space with dedicated workspaces, greenery, and decorative touches can inspire you to work.

2. **Prime location**

    Real estate is expensive and renting an office in a popular locale will probably be way beyond one&#39;s budget. Thankfully, there are coworking cafés and shared offices situated in coveted locations. So, you can work out of a good address without spending a bomb.

3. **Ergonomic furniture**

    Yup, all coworking spaces offer seating. But there are coworking spaces with furniture that&#39;s not just easy on the eye but is also ergonomic and functional. And if you sit behind a table for hours, you know how important that is. A chair with lumbar support and comfortable cushioning allows you to work without feeling the hours go by.

4. **Fully-equipped**

    The availability of amenities such as a projector, a scanner, a whiteboard and a printer, etc. at a coworking space is always a plus, especially, if you need to make a presentation or hold a workshop. This way you don&#39;t have to invest in equipment and can use that money in more useful pursuits instead.

5. **Extra Facilities**

    Parking onsite, different types of workspaces (such as private cabin, shared offices) within the same building, membership passes, and tie-ups and discounts with partnered companies are all additional perks, offered by some coworking spaces. This certainly adds to the appeal of working out of them.

6. **Time to meet Humans!**

    After the long hiatus of self-quarantines and social distancing, with the economy hitting back, may be its time to carry on with a life. In a coworking space get a chance to meet and greet people from different professional backgrounds and many at times working together. A good coworking space has a certain ambiance and culture to it. A space that promotes networking and is conducive to collaborating and being productive will always be sought after.
